<!--Put your code in an index.html and create a GitHub repository to share it.
    Make an App component which will render the full resumÃ©.
    Use semantic HTML throughout the page, so, a header, main, section and address.
    Include the contact information section with the name, email address, phone number, and a picture. 
        Feel free to choose one or use this image of Ilana from Broad City as a stand-in for Sally.

    There should be a section for Sally's employment history with at least 2 entries, each with the company name, 
        job title, dates of employment and a short description.
    As a stretch, write some responsive, mobile-first CSS styles for this application to keep practicing those CSS skills. We don't want to go rusty with CSS.
    A second stretch would be to use a prop to control the student's name that's being rendered.-->
